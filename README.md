# Optimizing Revenue Leakages and Profitability in the Hospitality Sector

This project was built as part of an academic initiative under **IIT Guwahati**.  
The goal was to leverage **data analytics** to identify and reduce revenue leakages while improving profitability in the hospitality sector using hotel booking data.

---

## Objective
Analyze booking behavior, cancellations, revenue patterns, and customer trends to provide actionable business insights for hotels and the hospitality industry.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (via Google Colab)  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Exploratory analysis

## Key Insights
- High cancellation rates observed in city hotels and during specific seasons  
- Repeated guests were more likely to complete bookings  
- Longer stays generated more revenue but had a higher likelihood of cancellation if not prepaid  
- Distribution channels and lead times significantly influenced booking patterns
